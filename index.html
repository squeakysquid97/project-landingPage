      <h2>Story</h2>
      <p><strong>Hi there! We're IOTA Inc.</strong> </p>
      <p>We’ve re-designed the calendar to simplify your life. After two previously successful calendar Kickstarters,
        we’re
        back
        with our 2021 version - now made to be as forgiving as a whiteboard, yet as beautiful as an art piece.</p>

      <h2>Use it However You'd Like</h2>
      <p>Plan vacations, birthdays, or anniversaries. Make a colored Gantt chart. Start bullet journaling. Count the
        days as they
        pass. This calendar provides just enough structure without getting in the way.</p>
      <p>Funny thing is, it looks so nice, that you might just want to leave it alone.

      <h2>Testimonials from 2019 and 2020</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><q>I'm a writer working on my first novel and the Minimalist calendar has been PERFECT for me. I love that
            it reflects the
            fluidity and non-stop reality of time and shows me in one view the entire year, past and present.</q>
          –Laura, Portland
          Oregon</li>
        <li><q>We got a lot of use as a family calendar keeping us on the same page… Now I’m hooked!</q> –Jesse,
          Denver Colorado</li>
        <li><q>Your calendar has had a pretty significant effect on my life. By forcing myself to realize that time is
            passing, and
            questioning how important the thing that I'm spending my hours on, I think I've truly been living a more
            fulfilling
            life</q> –Phil, New York City

      <h2>Made by People Who Care</h2>
      <p>Carefully designed in Cambridge, and printed with love in Nashville. The people who’ve touched this product
        have had a
        love for minimal, yet high-quality design.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nick, the original calendar designer, has spent two years refining the design.</li>
        <li>Our printer has been operating for over 30+ years. You could say that they are world-class at what they
          do.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
      <p>Having done this project two previous times (check out Nick's profile under the bios to take a look at them),
        it's hard
        to see any specific problems that might arise. We have a relationship with our printer whom we trust in
        Nashville. We've
        partnered with a fulfillment center not too far away to ensure that we can get the product to you on time. We
        are fairly
        confident that we can get the calendar into U.S. households before Christmas.

      <h3>Long-lasting design</h3>
      <p>We've changed the calendar materials this year so that it acts as a dry-erase whiteboard. No more making a
        mistake and
        feeling to need to throw out the entire thing!</p>
